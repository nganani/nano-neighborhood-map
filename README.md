# Brookline Neighborhood Map
Project #5 in Udacity Nanodegree Full Stack Web Developer course

## What's in it
* HTML/JS/CSS single page project showing list of locations retrieved on
previous project via Google Search API (in other words, I did not choose
my favorite places, i chose the location and let Google choose it for me :)

* Fully responsive, tested on mobile, laptop and large monitor

* Looked at a lot of projects from fellow 'Udacians', learned a lot while
trying to have my own voice & choices in the project

## How to use
* Download or clone this repo

* In `index.html` file, add your Google API Key instead of the placeholder
I added there. Hint: search for ```https://maps.googleapis.com/maps/api/js?key=```

* Double-click `index.html` and the map should show in your browser.
Alternatively, host the code on a web server to see it from mobile or any
browser out there
